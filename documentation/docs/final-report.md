**Project:** Data assembly and cleaning Of NMCP Yemen and automating the workflow

## Executive Summary

**Challenge:** The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Yemen faces significant challenges in analyzing and utilizing its vast data on malaria control activities due to inconsistencies in data formats, codes, and collection methods. This lack of data accessibility and quality hinders effective program evaluation, intervention targeting, and resource allocation.

**Approach:** The project used a Collaborative Approach Engaging a cross-functional team to collaboratively address inconsistencies in data formats, Actively involving *Risk analysis team* in harmonization decisions, ensuring alignment with program goals, and Iteratively refining entity relationships based on feedback from them and NMCP management. The collaborative approach has resulted in a coherent dataset that reflects the collective expertise of the team.

**Result:** This project successfully mapped all NMCP activity data into a structured format, significantly improving data accessibility and quality. Data completeness and accuracy metrics saw substantial improvements, and the established data model allows for comprehensive analysis across different entities and activities. Data visualization dashboards now provide real-time insights into key malaria control indicators, enabling informed decision-making for program optimization and resource allocation. Any Future data can be easily checked, validated, cleaned, and merged using the automated solution and the pipeline developed in this project.

**Impact:** This project empowers the NMCP with a robust data foundation for effective malaria control efforts. Improved data accessibility and quality will lead to:

* **Enhanced program monitoring and evaluation:** Real-time data insights will enable the NMCP to track progress towards malaria elimination goals and identify areas requiring improvement.
* **Targeted interventions:** Data-driven analysis will inform the development of more effective and targeted interventions, maximizing resource utilization and impact.
* **Improved resource allocation:** Data analysis will guide the allocation of resources to areas with the highest burden of malaria, ensuring efficient and equitable program implementation.
* **Knowledge sharing and collaboration:** The structured data model facilitates data sharing and collaboration with other stakeholders, promoting knowledge exchange and coordinated efforts in malaria control.

**Recommendations:** Building upon this success, the NMCP should:

* **Continue data quality improvement:** Implement ongoing data quality monitoring and maintenance procedures to ensure data integrity and reliability.
* **Integrate with other data sources:** Combine malaria control data with other relevant data sources (e.g., weather, population) for comprehensive analysis and prediction.
* **Promote data utilization:** Train NMCP personnel and stakeholders on data analysis tools and techniques to maximize the utilization of data for informed decision-making.

By leveraging the foundation established by this project, the NMCP can accelerate its progress towards a malaria-free future in Yemen.

## Introduction

Malaria remains a significant public health threat in Yemen, with 150K cases reported annually. Effective control requires a comprehensive understanding of the disease dynamics, intervention effectiveness, and resource allocation strategies. However, the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) faces significant challenges in utilizing its vast data on malaria control activities due to:

* **Data inconsistencies:** Data from various sources often use different formats, codes, and collection methods, making it difficult to integrate and analyze effectively.
* **Data quality issues:** Incompleteness, inaccuracies, and missing data further hinder the reliability and usability of the information.
* **Limited data accessibility:** Data is often stored in disparate silos, making it difficult for program managers and stakeholders to access and utilize it for informed decision-making.

Recognizing these challenges, the NMCP embarked on a critical initiative to map all its activity data into a unified, structured format. This project aimed to:

* **Create master lists:** Review and Update the standardized lists available of key entities involved in malaria control, such as villages, health facilities, and community health volunteers. and develop the missing ones needed for the mapping process.
* **Connect/Define Catchment of each health facilities:** connect health facilities with their corresponding catchment villages. Building on an Existing mapping and utilizing a data-driven approach and robust methodologies, to establish a detailed catchment map that empowers informed resource allocation and optimizes service delivery within the region.
* **Automated Data Pipelines (Pentaho and Python-Powered):** Implement lately to streamlined data processing and maintained data integrity throughout the analysis by employing Pentaho to orchestrate data extraction, and transformation processes. create scripts to address some data inconsistencies, including standardization, and normalization.
* **Clean and merge data:** Review, clean, and merge data routine/not routine data from various sources, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the master lists.
* **Develop data visualization tools:** Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize trends, analyze intervention effectiveness, and track progress towards malaria control goals.
* **Implement testing:** to guarantee data integrity and consistency before merging into the production Database.

This report details the methodology, results, and impact of this data mapping project. It highlights the significant improvements in data accessibility, quality, and utilization, paving the way for enhanced malaria control efforts in Yemen.
